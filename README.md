# Ironhack is losing clients

## Project Overview

Ironhack is currently facing a decline in its client base. To understand the severity and root causes of this issue, we turned to SwitchUp, a trusted source for client reviews and rankings. By extracting and analyzing this data, we aimed to uncover where Ironhack is falling short and why clients are turning away.

## Ranking Requirements
SwitchUp ranks educational institutions based on specific criteria. To be considered among the best, a school must:

* Have at least one U.S. campus or be U.S.-based if it offers online-only programs.
* Have at least 10 verified reviews since 2019.
* Maintain an average review rating of at least 4.5 out of 5.

## Analysis Results
Our analysis reveals troubling insights into Ironhack's current standings:
* Data Analytics: Ranked 4th
* Web Design: Ranked 3rd
* Coding Program: Alarmingly ranked 17th
* Cybersecurity: Absent from the rankings

The absence from the cybersecurity rankings is particularly concerning. As cybersecurity is a rapidly growing field with increasing demand, not being ranked in this category poses a significant threat to Ironhack's reputation and future success. Potential students heavily rely on reviews when choosing a school, and if Ironhack is not ranked in this vital field, they are likely to choose a competitor.

### Influencing Factors
Several factors could influence the overall score of educational institutions, including:

* Job Support: The assistance provided to students in securing employment after graduation.
* Curriculum: The relevance and comprehensiveness of the course content.
* Job Prices: The cost of the courses offered.

### Further Analysis
We conducted additional analyses including:

* Evaluating the locations of Ironhack's cybersecurity courses to see if they match the ranking requirements.
* Performing sentiment analysis on reviews and counting the number of verified reviews since 2019.
* Analyzing the badges and recognitions awarded to Ironhack.

## Recommendations

Our analysis indicates that Ironhack is not ranked for cybersecurity on SwitchUp because it does not meet any of the ranking requirements. To address this gap and improve Ironhack's overall standing, we propose the following recommendations:

#### Increase Student Reviews

1. **Encourage Feedback**: Actively solicit feedback from students by emphasizing the importance of reviews for continuous improvement and community building.
2. **Simplify Review Process**: Make the review process as straightforward as possible, reducing barriers to submission.
3. **Engage Multiple Platforms**: Encourage students to leave reviews not only on SwitchUp but also on other platforms like Course Report and Google Reviews.
4. **Encourage Name Inclusion**: Motivate students to include their names in reviews to add authenticity and credibility.

#### Improve Curriculum Support

1. **Recruit New Teachers**: Hire experienced instructors with a strong background in cybersecurity to enhance the quality of education.
2. **Invite Experts**: Regularly invite industry experts and professionals to give guest lectures and workshops, providing students with up-to-date knowledge and industry insights.

#### Improve Job Support

1. **Build a Strong Network with Hiring Companies**: Establish and nurture relationships with companies that hire cybersecurity professionals to facilitate job placements for graduates.
2. **Organize Recruitment Events**: Host job fairs, networking events, and hackathons to connect students directly with potential employers.
3. **Provide Career Coaching**: Offer career coaching services to help students with resume building, interview preparation, and job search strategies.

#### Open a Bootcamp in the U.S.

1. **Launch an On-site Cybersecurity Bootcamp in Miami**: Given the presence of an Ironhack campus in Miami, we recommend launching an on-site cybersecurity bootcamp there to meet the SwitchUp ranking requirements and attract more students.

By implementing these recommendations, Ironhack can enhance its cybersecurity offerings, meet ranking criteria, and ultimately regain its competitive edge in the educational sector.
