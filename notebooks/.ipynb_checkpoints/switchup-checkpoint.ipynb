    "\n",
    "*   Read this notebook and understand each function. Comment the code appropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Populate the list of schools with a wider variety of schools (how are you going to get the school ID?)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Take a look at the obtained dataframes. What dimensions do you have? what keys do you have? how could the different dataframes be connected?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go back to the drawing board and try to create an entity relationship diagram for tables available\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once you have the schemas you want, you will need to:\n",
    "  - create the suitable SQL queries to create the tables and populate them\n",
    "  - run these queries using the appropriate Python connectors\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Bonus: How will this datamodel be updated in the future? Please write auxiliary functions that test the database for data quality issues. For example: how could you make sure you only include the most recent comments when you re-run the script?\n",

    "# Suggested Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "* 5-6 minute presentation of data model created, decision process and business analysis proposed\n",

      "I'm so glad I found the Evolve Security Academy Cybersecurity Program because it would have been near impossible for me to curate all the course content, exercises, quizzes, labs, etc. on my own (despite the vast availability of free resources, this simply... Read More is a very hard thing to do). The format (live online lectures, coupled with some recorded lectures and work you do on your time) was very effective! You don’t miss out on class and instructor interactions, and, at the same time, you get through much of the material on your own time. Class meetings were M-Th evenings for 2 hours—that made it easier to do than a longer stretch of 3 hours. Office hours were held every evening we had class, so you get the best opportunity to ask questions and stay abreast of the material. The Saturday classes were every other week for 5 hours, which allowed time for assessments, extended exercises, and labs. The curriculum was laid out in a logical sense, with additional resources given if you want to learn/practice even more. Having quizzes, many labs, and assessments kept us in line with the material. The best part of the program: the instructors and teaching assistants (T.A.s) -- knowledgeable professionals, fully available and helpful to a 'T'. Even though I loved all the instructors, I would say this program would not be the same without the close assistance of the T.A.s! I'd highly recommend the ESA bootcamp because it's a professional program and very well executed, with a huge amount of learning opportunities, and it prepares someone for an entry-level job in cybersecurity. The support in terms of instructors, TAs, the director, our career coach, the CyberLab learning portal, etc. is truly outstanding!Read Less\n",

      "I need to share some key insights after attending Evolve Security Academy's Cybersecurity boot camp. While some may speak highly of the academy, my experience left me disheartened and wishing I had spent my time and resources elsewhere. The academy's... Read More teaching model appears sound initially, as it assigns each student a Teacher Assistant (TA), usually a graduate from the previous cohort. However, this quickly becomes an issue as these TAs are more proctors than instructors, often resorting to Google when challenged by a question and simply relaying unsolvable queries back to the main instructor. The course costs $13,950 for 240 equivalent class hours, plus an expected additional self-study time outside of the 2-hour evening classes. Upon reflection, better value and industry recognition could be achieved through a similar-priced course from SANS, an established name in the cybersecurity field. While the fundamentals of IT and cybersecurity are initially touched upon by Evolve's more adept instructors, the post-fundamentals course swiftly degenerates into a hurried overview of the multifaceted domains of cybersecurity. This felt like a superficial tour, with an excessive emphasis on penetration testing, possibly a veiled upsell of their Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) preparation course. Despite the curriculum boasting hands-on material, many instructors seemed more engaged in troubleshooting legacy lab exercises dating back to 2019/2020 than actual teaching. This lack of attention to the teaching material, which in part needed to be updated, hampered learning and often led to network failures, including during the final practical web application assessment. Including Python coding was a welcome thought, but the lessons were a rushed, last-minute addition that felt like an afterthought rather than an integral part of the curriculum. In terms of career support, Evolve fell drastically short. The \"support\" mostly consisted of rehashed slideshow presentations and brief, 30-minute 1-to-1 career coach sessions that ended abruptly, with no follow-up. One disheartening experience was when a career coaching day was wasted playing an unrelated trivia game due to a lack of planning. The alumni panel presented to us seemed unprepared for the job market, needing more fundamental IT skills such as Windows system administration and active directory management. Post-cohort, they applied to over 100 jobs only to be routinely dismissed. The course began promisingly, introducing basic tools and techniques useful in the cybersecurity field. However, an executive preferred flashy, engaging content over substantive, job-relevant information. This epitomizes the short-sightedness of the institution. I left the boot camp with a shiny final certificate but woefully under-equipped for most entry-level cybersecurity jobs. I was left to supplement my education on my own. The academy is more focused on monetary gain than genuinely imparting quality education. I would implore prospective students to consider these points carefully before deciding. More effective and value-for-money cybersecurity programs are available that genuinely prioritize student development and career success.Read Less\n",

There were times where I felt it went by really fast, and where I personally thought I might not succeed and I thought I was the only one that felt this way- but when I did study sessions outside of class time with other students, they felt the same way.

The staff and instructors were incredibly helpful, kind, knowledgeable, and available to help with any questions or concerns. They were all a Slack away and were often available outside of class hours. Speaking of class hours, the schedule was very reasonable and provided just enough time to feel challenging but not punishing. Two hours every Monday through Thursday and 4-5 hours every other Saturday meant that I could keep up with other commitments outside of class while continuing to stay connected to the curriculum. Classes were also reasonably broken down into lectures and lab-time which was conducive to a dynamic learning environment. We were able to absorb new information in a formal class setting while we also got to look forward to breaking out into more casual groups to focus on hands-on labs and presentation skills. The bootcamp does offer job search assistance in the form of 1-on-1 counseling, resume reviews, and group sessions with the career counselor every other Saturday. This help is here if you need it, however the bootcamp does not offer a job placement guarantee like other bootcamps. Therefore, career resources can be used at your discretion and I found these to be a great baseline for what's to come. Overall, I think this is a great curriculum for beginners and veterans alike who require some flexibility in their schedules. The course is unequivocally challenging and will put your skills and mind to the test. Additionally, there are some topics that are fairly skin deep, so outside learning is almost fundamental.

      "I attended Evolve Security Academy's part time program in the Summer/Fall of 2016.

Read More reasons, all students enter the academy with a fundamental understanding of necessary technological concepts so that every student can hit the ground running regardless of their background.Fellow Students:One of the best attributes of any good bootcamp is the diverse backgrounds from which Students come from, and Evolve is no different. As Evolve promotes teamwork and cooperation in many of their assignments, I welcomed the insights provided by my fellow students with backgrounds in Windows, Mac and Networking.Instructors:The instructors were fantastic. Evolve brought in many prominent professionals in security industry in order to compliment the curriculum. Curriculum:Entering the academy as a developer, I already had a proficiency in different programming languages and familiarity with the command line/linux. However, Evolve's greatest strength is its comprehensive curriculum, which covers topics such as Physical Security, Networking, Social Engineering, Cryptography, and Penetration Testing. As a developer, I had a relatively weak background in Networking but was able to walk away with an exceptional understanding of the TCP/IP transport protocol. Because of this, I am now able to not only spin up virtual machines for development and pen testing, but also create virtual networks within which these machines can operate. In addition, Physical Security and Social Engineering were threat vectors that I rarely considered until I attended Evolve. It's this complete approach to Security that makes Evolve's curriculum so effective. Not all students are interested in pen testing. While some of the graduates went on to work in application testing, others decided to pursue work in network security, systems administration, or corporate policy. It's a myth that working in the security industry means you're just hacking systems. There are so many different roles within the security industry and Evolve's curriculum ensures that you walk away with an exposure to all of them.Life BalanceEvolve's part time cohort ran Monday through Thursday from 6pm to 9pm and an additional class from 10am to 3pm every other Saturday. Most of the students were also employed full time, and Evolve went out of its way to ensure that the work load was appropriate given students' other commitments. Scholarships:In addition to being able to continue working full time, I was also able to receive a scholarship from Evolve in order to help finance tuition costs.Venue:As a bonus, Evolve is based out of 1871 in Chicago. 1871 is an amazing workspace that hosts countless events and provides a great environment in which to work and meet people.Read Less\n",

      "I completed Springboard's Cyber Security Career Track course in April 2024 and am very happy that I decided to go with Springboard. I am a former coach/teacher with zero IT/Tech experience, minus building and maintaining my PC during COVID and teaching... Read More the older coaches how to use a laptop, lol. I had researched and talked to multiple boot camps offering a cybersecurity track but needed a course that would allow me to work at my own pace and not be confined to pre-determined meeting times. After much deliberation, I decided to go with Springboard and am very pleased with my experience. The enrollment process was very easy, they offered a deferred tuition plan and also had a job guarantee program. I ultimately choose Springboard because of the deferred payment option and also the job guarantee. The units were very informative and a good mixture of reading, videos, writing projects, and interactive labs that allowed you to deepen your knowledge regardless of your prior knowledge/experience. Each unit also concluded with a short quiz to test your knowledge and allowed you the opportunity to go back and relearn any material. The writing projects often comprised of researching a particular vulnerability, breach, and/or company and answering questions about the particular unit. The hands-on labs were my favorite part of the course as they allowed you to put learning into practice with detailed steps. I do wish the labs were more detailed in terms of explaining exactly why you were taking a particular step, but post-completion labs have allowed me to fill in those missing pieces. I also liked the personal mentor they provided and my mentor was extremely helpful throughout my two+ months within the course. As far as aspects of the course I disliked; I do wish the career coaching calls were more personalized. The Effective Networking call was extremely informative and I did get a lot of great information from that particular call, but I felt the Career Kick-Off, Career Planning, and Career Branding calls could have been better. The Resume and LinkedIn call was also a little disheartening as the coach had not researched or looked into my information before the call. I felt like the resume building was just copying and pasting my name onto a cookie-cutter resume that had been used multiple times. I didn't feel like that call was designed to tailor my resume specifically to me, but that it was designed to simply pass for a grade. We also did not even talk about my LinkedIn and I was rushed off the call as the coach had another student's call after mine (she also used my time to respond to that student). I also felt that I was not being commended for the pace in which I was completing the course. They (Springboard) do state that they recommend taking six months to complete the entire course and I finished in two. I felt that my mentor was the only person on my side and that when I got on a coaching call it was as if I was making a mistake with how fast I was progressing. Lastly, I also never heard from my student advisor. I'm not sure if that was intended or their role exactly, but I know I never heard from him throughout the two+ months. I was very satisfied with the mock interviews and the coaches that conducted them. All three gentlemen were professional, asked tough questions, and provided amazing feedback for me to use. Applying for completion was also very easy. I am happy with my current career coach post-completion and look forward to her mentorship during my job search. I would highly recommend Springboard for those self-motivated and determined individuals. Thank you, Springboard!Read Less\n",

      "Embarking on a career change into cybersecurity seemed like a daunting task for someone like me, with no formal technical experience. However, my journey with Springboard Cyber Security Career Track has been nothing short of transformative, leading me... Read More from a place of uncertainty to landing my first role as a Security Analyst within a year. I began my Springboard course in March 2023, armed with determination and a willingness to learn. The curriculum provided a comprehensive foundation in cybersecurity, covering essential topics ranging from threat detection to risk management. What truly set Springboard apart was its holistic approach to learning. Not only did I gain technical expertise, but there was also a strong emphasis on networking and personal branding. One aspect that significantly contributed to my success was the opportunity to become a Springboard cybersecurity peer mentor. This role not only solidified my understanding of the material but also allowed me to engage with and learn from fellow learners, fostering a sense of community and collaboration. In December, I achieved significant milestones by obtaining certifications such as CompTIA Security+ and (ISC)² CC. These credentials bolstered my credibility in the field and opened doors to new opportunities. However, the true testament to Springboard's efficacy came when I secured my first role as a Security Analyst in February of the following year. The personalized support I received throughout my journey, including one-on-one sessions with mentors and career coaches, was invaluable. They provided guidance, encouragement, and practical advice, steering me towards the right direction every step of the way. Moreover, Springboard's emphasis on developing my professional brand through LinkedIn profile and resume reviews proved instrumental in showcasing my skills and experiences to potential employers. Reflecting on my experience, I firmly believe that Springboard has the potential to empower anyone with the desire to switch careers to cybersecurity. The structured curriculum, combined with personalized mentorship and career guidance, creates an environment conducive to success. My journey with Springboard has not only equipped me with the necessary skills but also instilled the confidence to thrive in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity.

The curriculum contains videos, labs and projects and students are paired with a mentor which they meet with once per week.

Students meet with career coaches periodically throughout the program and also have access to them for 6 months after graduation. All the career coaches I have met with were amazing. The job guarantee support is good from what I hear, however I did not sign up for the guarantee option so I can only speak so much on it. I will say, that as a non job guarantee student , the job support and career resources have been fantastic. This program is entirely online, offering students flexibility if they have other obligations in their personal and professional lives. If you are looking for an in person experience, you may have to consider something else. What you get out of this program is what you put in so try to get the most out of all the resources Springboard makes available to its students. Some things that helped me were taking good notes and asking the mentors and career coaches lots of questions. Springboard also hosts weekly office hours giving you another opportunity to ask any questions you may have. Before you sign up for a bootcamp, I always recommend doing thorough research into the field you are interested in. Bootcamps can be challenging , so if you aren't sure about the field , you may find it hard to keep your motivation up.

      "I have completed the Springboard Cybersecurity bootcamp and gotten my CompTIA Security + certification. I was part of the March 2022 cohort and completed my bootcamp on October 16 2022. I completed my Job Guarantee period (6 months) without receiving... Read More any offers and got a full refund from the program. Executive Summary: I would NOT recommend this bootcamp to anyone. After not being able to get a Cybersecurity job my Career coach advised me to look at Help Desk potions. The bootcamp does not give you the skills required by help desk positions. (Also, I did not take a Cybersecurity bootcamp so that I could work at a help desk.) The material you are given is not unique to Springboard. The technical material is LinkedIn learning videos that can be accessed for $30 a month with a LinkedIn Premium membership. The instructions for the mini-projects are vague and incomplete. The mentors are not well screened. I was ghosted by 2 mentors in my first week. It also seems like they are also not given all the material necessary to properly help students through the course. I do not believe that the material presented in this bootcamp alone would prepare you to take and pass the CompTIA Security plus exam. About me: I have a bachelors in Electrical Engineering from Cal Poly SLO. I have worked at Lockheed Martin for almost 7 years as a Systems Engineer. I worked as a Customer Support Engineer for Orbotech for 6 months. I have been a stay at home dad since 7/2015. During that time I also completed the Intro to Programming Nanodegree from Udacity. Decision to join Springboard: I made the decision to take the Springboard bootcamp because on previous attempts to get back into the work force employers saw my career gap as a negative. I wanted to put something recent on my resume and show employers that I was still able to work/learn. I had been reading a lot in the news about cyber attacks and how they had become more frequent and how there was a shortage of cybersecurity professionals. Cybersecurity seemed like a good area to go into since already had a technical background. I thought taking the bootcamp and getting my CompTIA Security + certificate would allow to get a job without having to go back to square one in my career, like going back to taking a help desk job. To join the boot camp I did an intake interview. During the interview I talked to an admission person and explained to him why was joining the bootcamp. He talked to me about the program and what to expect. The main reasons for choosing the springboard bootcamp over other bootcamps were: Its significantly cheaper than other bootcamps. Offers a job guarantee. If I don’t get a job in 6 months after completing I get my money back. None of the other boptcamps I looked at had this. One on One mentorship. Was suppose to be focused more on blue team (defense) then red team (hacking). It was done through Self paced online learning. Job hunting after the bootcamp: I will get back to the bootcamp in just a minute. After completing the bootcamp successfully and getting my CompTIA Security plus certificate I started the job hunting process around 10/16/2022. After 6 months and applying to over 140 jobs (some were more EE oriented but the vast majority were cybersecurity) I have had no offers. I have had multyiple interviews with recruiters and a few interviews with hiring managers but. The reason for this seems to be that the industry believes that Cybersecurity is not an entry level job. In order to get an “entry level” job in cybersecurity you need years of experience in IT. This is what is being told to me by recruiters, cyber security professionals that I talk to, and is being said all over LinkedIn posts. I talked to my career counselor about this and she suggested I start looking at IT support roles or Help desk positions and that I should my salary expectations 50-60K a year. When I looked at Help desk positions the pay is closer to 40K a year with no benefits. So I tried applying for IT roles and I got one interview. During the interview the person told me I was not what they were looking for, they wanted someone with more IT experience and that IT was not an entry level position. The skills they are looking for were windows troubleshooting, macOS troubleshooting, linux troubleshooting, what to do if one computer on your network can not see a network printer but all the other can. These are not skills covered in the Springboard Cybersecurity Bootcamp. After I talked to my Career counselor I talked to a Senior Career Service Manager about my experience. \\ The Manager also tried to say that the change could be due to the changing job market. But I talked to someone else (the week of 1/16/2023) that just did her intake interview and she was also told that she would be able to get a Cybersecurity Engineering position. This person was told that IT positions and Help desk positions were not qualifying positions for the job guarantee and therefore she would not be advised to apply to these roles. This is the exact opposite of what I am experiencing in the job search. The manager also told me that perhaps the person doing my intake interview did not understand that I was making a career transition which would affect my earning potential. However I talked to another springboard student who was transition from being a hairdresser to cybersecurity and she was also told that she would be able to earn between 90-130K after the bootcamp. So while the manager tried to give me lots of different reasons for why the information given to me during the intake interview did not match what I am experiencing during the job hunt, none of them really held any water. I have also not seen any materialization of these “industry partnerships” that were discussed during both the intake interview and the course. They have a partnership with a job board “Power to Fly” but when I look for cybersecurity jobs there I find nothing. And also, it is just another job board, nothing really special about it. I filled out Springboards “Employer Partnership On boarding Form”, have not heard anything from that. I get a monthly newsletter about jobs and the last one had 1 cybersecurity job listed on it, but like the ones I find myself it required years of experience. I asked the Senior Manager of the Careers department about this. She told me that it’s been really hard and slow to develop industry partnerships within cybersecurity. Well if they have not been able to build these industry partnerships then they should not be advertising them during the intake interview or the course work. I also talked with another Senior Manager at Career Services and the conversation went pretty much the same. I also talked with a Senior Director of Admissions at Springboard. He semed to loisted to me more then the previous people. He said he would take my feedback and share it with his team but no immediate help for me. The boot camp: The Point system and Time estimates: Since the bootcamp is self paced all the material is done via online videos. Almost all the videos are LinkedIn learning videos. You can get access to LinkedIn learning for $30 a month. For sixth months (the amount of time the bootcamp is suppose to take) that would be $180. If you pay for the bootcamp all up front, one of the cheapest ways if not the cheapest way, its $9900. Springboard does not provide extra notes, or enrichment material for these videos. It’s just a link that takes you to LinkedIn and plays the video. The boot camp assigns point to all the assignments that you are suppose to complete. In order to finish the bootcamp in 6 months they recommend you complete about 400 point a week. They advertise that this should take 13-20 hours a week. I talked to several students who were enrolled at the same time as me and none of them finished in six months. I also took longer than six months to complete. The problem with this is that there time estimates that are shown per video are wrong. For example in Section 5.1 they say the time is between 3 hours 15 minutes and 4.5 hours. This broken down into 2 hours 55 minutes to 4 hours to watch the course and 20-30 minutes to take notes. The total runtime of the video is 3 hours and 20 minutes. How do you watch a 3 hour 20 minute video in 2 hours and 55 minutes? If the total runtime of the video is 3 hours 20 minutes then the minimum amount of time for the exercise should be 3 hours 20 minutes. This section is even worse because there were multiple exercises, quizzes, a test, and extra documentation to read with this video. If you do all of the exercises in the video and the quizzes and the test I would estimate this section taking 8.5 hours. I remember there was another section where springboards max time estimate was 30 mins short of the runtime of the LinkedIn learning video. Almost all the sections have this problem, where the minimum time that springboard estimates is less than the run time of the video. Most are only 5-10 minutes but it starts to add up over the course of the entire bootcamp. And these times are how they calculate the points for each video and therefore effects the time it takes to get your 400 points per week. When you gain access to springboards course there will be a timeline shown and it will break down which sections you should be completing each week. But this timeline does not align with the 400 points per week. There was one week where the timeline said I should only complete 230points. These might not seem like major errors but when you pay $9900 for a course I would expect it to not have this many simple errors, I mean how hard it to make sure the time listed on your course matches the time given by LinkedIn? Mini Projects: Another element to the course is what they call “mini-projects”. These mini-projects can be anything from reading an article and answering a coupled of questions about it to writing a script in python or pearl. Often times the instructions to these mini-projects were ambiguous. Here is some feedback I gave to Springboard about Mini Project 8 and 9: In the video Project Management Foundations the presenter kept saying we would get all the specific information that we would need for the documentation from the Key Stake holders. So obviously we do not have actual stake holders we can sit down with and pick their brains for information. So I would have expected to have more details about the project in information pack given. But no, the information given was very limited. For example, mini project 8 the project was to “install wifi” for a hair salon. Well the first question is, what does “install wifi” mean. Does it mean just install a wifi router, does she need an ISP with wifi, does she want the “social wifi” talked about in the links provided in the document? I decided to go with the most literal interpretation which is to install a wifi router. This however seems to make the project ridiculously simple and not worth the effort of going through project management process. I mean in the real world her ISP would probably provide her with a wifi router as part of her monthly subscription, mine does. So maybe more realistic project would be better. I see it says that some of the information was left out on purpose to make exercise what we learned but the project definition should not be some of the information that is left out. Mini-project 9 suffers from some of the same problems as mini-project 8. Lack of definition, lack of information that would come form the stake holders. But there is more, the information in the packet provided is contradictory. In the objectives it says you want to deploy Windows 10 by January 2020 but then in the timeline you don’t even start work tell second quarter 2021. Also the roadmap delivery timeline indicates that work will go from Q2 2021 to Q1 2022, so less then a year. But in the Phase one Recommendations you have a task that is going to take 800-1600 days (2.2-4.4 years), so how do those work out? In the videos we watched it indicated that when you had problems like these you went to your stake holders and talked about it and got clarification or came up with a solution, but we have no stake holders to go to. I looked for help on slack and what I found was “make it up to fit”. That’s what I did and it work but if you are giving us a project to learn project management why make it more difficult and frustrating by not providing all the information or providing contradictory information? Why not give us clear information so we can understand what we are doing better and get a better experience? In another mini-project we are suppose to write a Pearl script. Just before the project there is video go over how to write scripts in Pearl. Just so you know, the bootcamp says you do not need any previous coding experience to complete the bootcamp. The video goes over how to download pearl to your computer and set up your Integrated development environment (IDE). Since I know I will need to write a pearl script after watching the video I try and follow the steps in the video. However the steps in the video do not work because the websites referenced in the video have changed (the video is from 2016). I go to the springboard slack channel and find other students have had the same problem and they have posted a work around. A representative form springboard responded to posts about the problem (they did not give a solution) and the solutions the students posted. These posts were already 6 months old at the time. This means Springboard new about the problem, knew what the solution was, and yet did not update the course material for at least six months. All they had to do was write up the steps given in slack into a document and post the document under this section on the website. For a competent web designer this should have only taken a few hours at most. In another mini-project they asked us to setup a phishing campaign using the GoPish software. This was one part of mini-project and the total time for the mini-project was estimated to be around 4 hours I believe. There were several problems for this mini-project. They did not provide us with detailed instructions on how to make GoPish work; just the tutorial the website provides which is not great. I was not able to get it to work properly but submitted the steps that I believed would make it work. When I talked to my mentor about it he said that the first time he used GoPhish it took him several days to get it to work properly. How can springboard expect students who are not cyber security experts to make this work in a couple hours when it takes experienced Cybersecurity personal a couple days to get it setup right? I have previously provided this feedback to Springbaord and the response I get is them saying that they have flagged the feedback for review and are considering making changes. I also remember reading on the slack a Springboard representative saying they leave the instructions somewhat ambiguous on purpose to allow the students to figure out their own solutions. But if you read what the students are posting on the Slack channel what is actually happening is that the students are being confused and getting frustrated by the lack of clear direction. Labs: Part of the Springboard course is doing labs. For these labs they have contracted with a company called Infosec learning. You log into the webpage and its sets up a virtual environment for you to conduct your lab. The main problem I have with these labs are that the instructions are so dumbed down that you do not have to think to complete the lab and therefore I think the information retention form them is minimal. For example the instructions don’t say “close the window” they say “close the window by clicking on the red x in the upper right hand corner.” They don’t say “search for term xyz” they say “Type xyz into the search field and then use the cursor to click on the arrow at the right of the search field to conduct the search”. Those might not be the exact instruction they give but you get the idea. This is how you give instructions to people who are not familiar with the basics of using a computer not to people who are taking an online bootcamp. This might seem minor but if you are familiar with how to use computers and have to slog through reading pages of instruction like this it becomes boring and detracts from the learning experience. Mentors: Part of the Springboard bootcamp is that you have 1 on 1 meetings with a mentor every week. The mentors are people who work in the industry and are supposed to answer your questions about the course material or the projects or just about the industry in general. When I joined I was setup to have my first mentor meeting on Wednesday of the first week. The mentor did not show for the meeting. I let Springboard know, they set me up with a second mentor for Friday. The second mentor did not show. I was then set up with a third mentor who did show up to the meeting. I never found out why the first two mentors did not show. I went on the Springboard Slack channel and asked if other people were having this problem. While no one else had two mentors ghost them, I do remember people saying that they had mentors show up late, were in rush to leave, or just did not seem that good at explaining cybersecurity. It seems like Springboard needs to revise their screening for their mentors. Another feature of the Bootcamp is On demand mentors. If you have a question in between your regularly scheduled mentor meetings you can schedule a meeting with an on demand mentor. I had a problem with one of the mini-projects because the instructions were incomplete so I scheduled an on demand mentor. The problem I was having was I did not understand what value they wanted me to put in a column of a spreadsheet. I asked my on demand mentor what I was suppose to put in this column and his answer was something like “That’s a good question, I don’t know.” How can he not know, part of his job is to help students with projects. If he had students assigned to him he would be grading these projects. Shouldn’t Springboard have given him templates of what the finished projects look like so he knows how to grade them and answer these questions? Another thing that I saw was mentors on the same slack channel as the students, asking for guidance or examples on how to grade the mini-projects because they did not know the answers. I would think there would be some kind of on boarding for the mentors where springboard takes them through the mini-projects and what is expected in each one. Or at the very least would provide them with examples to compare to. I would also think the mentors should have their own slack channel so that they can communicate without the students seeing it. After all you don’t want them answering each other question and showing the answer to the students on the slack channel.Read Less\n",

Yet, if you have no IT background be prepared for extensive Googling and research to complete your assigned projects. What is...

Pros: - Quick responses from Springboard Support - Create your own schedule - Helpful Infosec labs that give you hands-on experience - Graded mock interviews from professionals in the industry - Helpful community on Slack - Office Hours Some cons: - It's not a live weekly class, so you don't have an instructor teaching you this material.

      "This program is an enormous scam and not worth your time. Everything they cover could be told to you by a very determined google search on the subjects they cover. They in no way, shape, or form offer you anything that you could not look up yourself and... Read More figure out. The labs are very basic walkthroughs that Quickstart doesn't even make, they give you little to no actual experience doing the things that you would expect to be doing as a cybersecurity professional. The support staff hardly ever respond if they do, and if they do they might get annoyed with you because you asked them to do their job instead of sitting around ignoring your emails. The coaches are awesome as people, but besides answering your questions and presenting a short slide presentation each time, they cannot really offer you much in terms of mentoring. This course would be beneficial if I already had a degree and had been in the tech field for some time, but the irony is they advertise to people who specifically do not have these qualifications and are trying to get them. One of the \"academic counselors\", Aly basically laughed at me when I told him I was trying to be a cybersecurity professional by attending the course, and mentioned he only knew of one person who took the course and became a cybersecurity professional. The \"job support\" offered by the program is non-existent and is comprised of a company called Revature which is a training mill for aspiring coders who have degrees in other fields and want to transition into tech. The funny thing is, I took this course to become a cybersecurity professional, not to be foisted onto a coding mill company. Avoid this bootcamp, it is not worth your money or time and will not help you become a cybersecurity professional. Last thing, they offer you extra credit opportunities during the course and these opportunities are basically asking you to make free advertising material for them, which is why you'll see so many reviews about Quickstart being remarkably positive despite not saying anything really substantive about the program at all. Take my advice, do not fall for this scam.Read Less\n",

The labs are very, VERY helpful and give step-by-step instructions on how to complete them and they are all relevant to the projects assigned in the course. I wasn't expecting the amount of resources available to help learn on my own, but I found myself rarely having to ask questions or for help due to the nature of the labs walking you through the basic steps leading up to completing all of the projects, which actually pertain to real-life application, with little to no guidance.

You are able to retake exams, the final exams were “open book” (so you can use all the modules to check for the correct answers) and sometimes the exams asked questions not mentioned in the theory. I feel that my grade has no value since everyone graduated (copying). If they were real exams, I think more than 1/2 of my cohort would have failed. We wasted a lot of time doing icebreakers, group challenges and nonsense presentations.(Icebreaker=talking about your favorite animal/color/movie…) Some of the group presentations, were incomprehensible since some of my classmates didn’t speak english good enough. Working with them was really frustrating. I was told you had to have a minimum level of english and intellectual capacity to be able to join, but after experiencing the bootcamp, I can say they get in anyone with the money. I thought Ironhack was the best place to change your career, but now I realized is only one more bootcamp trying to get your money. I don’t recommend you to take the Ironhack Cybersecurity Bootcamp. Pay for an academy to learn the foundations and then take the CompTIA Sec+ certification. (The bootcamp only covers 60% of the content of this certificate) It was a complete waste of money and time. I was scammed. I hope Ironhack realizes what is doing wrong and improves their bootcamps for the future students.Read Less\n",

      "['Pros: -The bootcamp gave me a trajectory to follow in terms of where to look for knowledge. -I was given hands on experience with multiple tools used in the field. -I was able to make connections in the cyber field. -I was able to become very good friends... Read More with my group and collaborate on projects outside of school. -The bootcamp gives a voucher for the CompTIA security+ exam. Cons: -Constantly going through lead instructors. -The lead instructor when I left taught nothing and relied on the assistant instructors to teach. -I believe the cohort is incredibly overpriced for what you get. -I was lucky to get an AI who was not condescending, not every group gets one.Read Less', \"I joined this boot camp because I wanted more hands-on lab experience, accountability, and networking with others. This bootcamp was also more affordable than a Master's degree (I have a Bachelor's in Sociology, but wanted to get into Cybersecurity).... Read More When comparing the course content between this bootcamp and a Master's degree, I found that this bootcamp had more practical learning, and not just lecturing you like a traditional class setting. If you're someone who also has these desires, this may be the place for you! Pros: - Non-competitive learning environment where you can work together - Friendly and understanding instructors, always there to help and quick replies - Instructors always want to improve the bootcamp and accept criticism - Encourages you to push out of your comfort zone to enable success (for this bootcamp and also for job preparation) - Lots of opportunity for hands on labs - Creating life long friends - Friends/classmates will motivate you to do TryHackMe boxes and other certifications to build your resume - Great job prepping material (Linkedin setup, tailored-resume, etc.) Mediating Factors: - You have to put in the effort to get the most out of the bootcamp - You have to study and take really good notes - You have to redo some of the labs if you want to understand it better - You have to ask for help if you need help Cons: - Sometimes there's issues with the virtual box or website, but they're usually solved very quickly and won't hold you accountable for mistakes on their end - The face-paced environment could be a con for some people who have a really busy schedule or work better in a slower paced environment. There were times where I felt it went by really fast, and where I personally thought I might not succeed and I thought I was the only one that felt this way- but when I did study sessions outside of class time with other students, they felt the same way. So don't feel discouraged. I learned to take away the big picture, take good notes, continously review, and study smarter. I was able to complete the bootcamp, and so can you! Focus more on topics you really enjoy and want to do in the future. - Sometimes the Zoom recordings don't get uploaded as fast as I want them to. It could be very difficult to catch up if you miss class. If you don't have access immediately, always reach out to classmates to catch up on missed-material. Overall, I am very satisfied with what I got out of this bootcamp. I think this was one of the best decisions that I have made, and will always support Evolve Security! I highly recommend this bootcamp for anyone wanting to be in the Cybersecurity field. Overall, I am very satisified with what I have accomplished in this bootcamp!Read Less\", \"Pros: knowledgeable instructors, well planned material Cons: a bit intense and time consuming Overall this was a great program. The course material was well planned and the instructors and fellow students were all eager for everyone to succeed without... Read More just giving us the answers. Emphasis on teaching not just the answers, but how to find the answers they don't teach.Read Less\", \"I'll start with pros as they are more prominent than the cons. Evolve Security Academy does a great job and it was definitely worth it. I got plenty of hands on experience working with many different industry tools. The teaching was excellent and the... Read More TA was very available and helpful. My teacher Joe Nicastro was incredibly thorough and also was able to explain very complicated information clearly and effectively. My Cohort was comprised of smart and hard working individuals who were great to collaborate with when we did group work. The lab work simulated real world situations. I also got really good help from career services updating my resume and coaching for interviews. The only con I have would be that I hoped recruiters would be coming directly to Evolve to interview students for entry level positions. You really have to hustle on your own, however, career services is helpful preparing you for this.Read Less\", \"Most of them are pros, if there are only a few cons I have for this academy is the access to recorded sessions needs to be more organized, I've already given a tip where they need to maybe add and attach the recording with a name label corresponding with... Read More the labs in the Cyber Lab. On top of that the schedule to attend to class, it would benefit them to add different class periods for more students to attend, because not everyone that are interested in this career can go to a 7-9 pm CST class due to personal/work situations. Anything other than that, I think they're doing great. Probably the best community I've had to pleasure to be a part of. Highly recommend, even if you have no IT experienceRead Less\", \"Pros--the breadth and pace of the content--it fits well for someone who looking to put the time in for a major career shift.
